# Dice Game (React)

A lightweight game to roll dice and keep score, great for practicing state updates and UI feedback.

## Why this project exists
- To manage turn-based state and transitions
- To practice conditional rendering based on game state

## What you will learn
- Component composition for board/controls
- Randomness and state updates
- Feedback via animations and conditional classes

## Learning path (step‑by‑step)
1) Render a dice face from a number 1–6
2) Add a Roll button to generate a new value
3) Track score/rounds and basic win logic
4) Add reset and simple animations

## Setup & scripts
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## Structure
- `src/components/*`: UI pieces of the game
- `src/App.jsx`: Game container and state

## Exercises
- Add multiplayer turns
- Add best-of series and a scoreboard
- Add sound effects
